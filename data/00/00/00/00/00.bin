  |   After an incident King Lucas had with the Witch of Sausan, the        |
  |   Queen left him and remarried in an adjacent kingdom, and now his      |
  |   daughters are the only ones left at his side. Due to his love for     |
  |   them, each and every time they get lost in the castle, he moves       |
  |   heaven and earth to get them back and he only resorts to the most     |
  |   intrepid knights in order to find them. Will you be one of those      |
  |   knights?                                                              |

  |   Play for the favour of King Lucas and the three princesses' love. A   |
  |   castle will be randomly built and you must find them inside a         |
  |   little area of it. You can move horizontally and vertically through   |
  |   the rooms until you reach your goal. Once you succeed, the castle     |
  |   will become a little bit more difficult: a larger area will be        |
  |   unlocked... and the experience will become more hardcore when the     |
  |   princess becomes lost inside a fully unlocked castle with more than   |
  |   1,000 rooms.                                                          |
